# bampfa_piction
This is a repository for efforts to clean up BAMPFA filenames and metadata in order to complete the upload into Piction.
After the initial migration of files to Piction, some 5000+ files were not successfully uploaded. Our hypothesis is that unicode characters in the filenames prevented Piction from ingesting the files. The Piction reupload project is the first project in this repository.
